Hi there! Thanks for purchasing the asset, I really hope you enjoy it and that it helps you take your projects to the next level :D

I’m always open for questions, feedback and suggestions. The best way to contact me is by email. Please don’t write questions in the Unity Forums, Youtube videos, Twitter or wherever else since I will probably miss them.
I always reply much faster (in 24h or less) by email.
When reaching out please attach your invoice number too and make sure you have read the Documentation PDF or watched the equivalent video playlist linked in the PDF.
The email address is: seasidegamestudios@gmail.com

If you are planning on using the asset on URP or HDRP please go to the First Steps section of the Documentation PDF. And if you are in Built-In you should probably go and take a look at the Documentation too ;)

The Documentation is structured in such a way that only reading the first 4 sections (until Shader Structure and Usage, that section included) is necessary to start using most of the asset features.
Everything else you can read as you go once you are familiar with the asset basic workflow.

If you like the asset please make sure to drop a review on the Asset Store page. It helps out a ton:
